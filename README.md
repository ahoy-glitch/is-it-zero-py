This is a python version of [is-it-zero](https://github.com/Niximkk/is-it-zero) (by Nix Raccoon).

When you forget if a number is zero or not, this code will help you.

To run the code you'll need to install python 3.11 and run the command: `python main.py`, or just use an online `IDE` like [Repl.it](https://replit.com)
